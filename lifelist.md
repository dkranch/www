title: "Life Lists"
subtitle: The things to do before you die
---

A life list is an interesting thing. I've known about bucket lists, even before [the movie](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0825232/), and I've thought about them, but I got inspired by Ted Leonsis. I've also enjoyed watching my friend, Brent Ozar, and his [epic life quest](https://ozar.me/quest/)

In case you just want the lists:

- [Steve's List](/lifelistSteve)
- Tia's List

He was a co-founder of AOL and became quite rich. He was also one of those attack-life-and-work-hard people. Especially in pushing his body. I was listening to Jim Rome one day and he interviewed Mr. Leonsis. He talked about the [101 things he wanted to do before he died](http://www.espn.com/page2/wash/s/020312leonsis.html). It was quite a list, impressive in scope and breadth. Not quite for me, but I loved it.

I linked to it at ESPN, but in case it disappears, here's the list. I think it's outdated, as I suspect ESPN doesn't keep it up to date. I thought during the interview he had played Jordan 1:1.
