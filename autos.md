I love cars, and this page is mostly about cars. However, I've started to have other vehicles over time, so I added a section for those. These are vehicles my wife or I have owned and driven around. I'm leaving off kid vehicles.

## Cars

These are the autors I've used for transporting myself around, or my wife has. We've not usually shared cars, though we both drive each others. The list is in no particular order. It used to be newest to oldest, but that's too hard to recreate.

1. 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 - Tia's hemi that couldn't handle the load.
2. 2004 Honda Odessey EXL - The new family car.
3. 2003 Dodge Durango SXT - Tia's main drive.
4. 2001 Isuzu Trooper LS - This is my third Trooper and I still enjoy it. I miss the sunroof I had in the last one, but this one runs, so that's a plus.
5. 1987 BMW 528e - My wife's car. She's had this for 10 years and loves it. Slowly over the years I've given her a few gifts to try and keep this one going. At present, we are debating getting rid of it, but I hate to since it's a cheap to own and nice to have 3rd car.
6. 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan - We had to when Kendall was born. With 5 in the family and trips to take, the space is really needed and used.
7. 2000 GMC Yukon XL - Nice truck, never drove it.
8. 1993 Isuzu Trooper LS - This is my second Trooper and I really enjoy it. I've had it for 4 years and it's served me well, though in early 2002, it required quite a bit of work.
9. 1970s Pontiac station wagon of some sort
10. 1990 GMC Surburban - I love this. Totaled by an Expedition.
11. 1987 Dodge Caravan - My beater, old, ran well, and pulled our 19' boat.
12. Acura Integra, 1992 I think.
13. 1992 Mercedes 240D
14. 1975 Pontiac Station Wagon - Not sure what year, but this was a huge v-8 beast, torn up interior, etc. But it cruised down the road, had space, and was a good fit for me for about 5-6 months.
15. 1990 Isuzu Trooper LS - This was my frist Trooper, actually my first new car as well.
16. 1980ish Saab 900 - A sweet car out of college. Engine troubles doomed this car.
17. 1982 Pontiac Bonneville - Tore up my shoulder and my parents gave me this when I couldn't shift anymore.
18. 1977 Volkswagen Scirocco - The first car I bought. I loved this one, put in a sunroof, cruised the beach.
19. 1980 Pontiac Bonneville - My Mom's old car and she gave it to me at 16.
20. 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel - Tia's workhorse.
21. 1988 Porsche 911 - My Dream Car.
22. 2007 Toyota Prius - The new family car that replaces the Caravan.
23. 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 - First porsche and very cool. Fun to drive and soon to go to the oldest as his first car.
24. 2010 Ford F250 King Ranch - We owned it only a few months and got rid of it. Far too many issues. Fix or Repair Daily might apply here.
25. 2011 Dodge 3500 - The diesel my wife wanted, bought new, and put on about 40,000 miles in 10 years.
26. 1998 Porsche 911 Targa - dream car that I owned for about 8 or 9 years. At some point it didn't fit the lifestyle and 


## Other Vehicles

I have owned a motorcycle, though I somewhat used to consider that a "car" as I commuted on it. However, since we live on the ranch, I added a few others:

- 1990 Suziki 500 Street motorcycle - My mom hated it, but I commuted in San Diego for almost a year on this bike. Over 1000 miles a month.
