title: "Vehicles I've Owned"
subtitle: The fun things I've had the opportunity to drive around
---

I love cars, and this page is mostly about cars. However, I've started to have other vehicles over time, so I added a section for those. These are vehicles my wife or I have owned and driven around. I'm leaving off kid vehicles.

## Current Cars

In use now (repeated below):
31. 2021 Tesla Model Y - The fastest and best car I've owned.
28. [2012 BMW X5 35i (E70)](/thoughts/bmwx5/) - I wanted a luxury SUV after the Suburban. I spent 3-4 months looking and got this. The most expensive car I bought, and I slightly regret it, but it's fun to drive.
25. 2011 Dodge 3500 - The diesel my wife wanted, bought new, and put on about 40,000 miles in 10 years.
26. [2001 Chevy Suburban](/thoughts/Suburban2001/) - We bought this with 101k miles for $6500 and at last check we'd owned it for 15 years, driven it all over the West, and it has 230k miles. The White Whale might be the best car I've owned.
## Cars

These are the autors I've used for transporting myself around, or my wife has. We've not usually shared cars, though we both drive each others. The list is in no particular order. It used to be newest to oldest, but that's too hard to recreate.

1. 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 - Tia's hemi that couldn't handle the load.
2. 2004 Honda Odessey EXL - The last minivan we owned and the only lease.
3. 2003 Dodge Durango SXT - an SUV that she enjoyed, but couldn't tow enough.
4. 2001 Isuzu Trooper LS - This was my third Trooper and I still enjoy it. I miss the sunroof I had in the last one, but this one runs, so that's a plus.
5. 1987 BMW 528e - The car my wife drove when I met her. She had this for 10 years and loves it. Slowly over the years I've given her a few gifts to try and keep this one going. At present, we are debating getting rid of it, but I hate to since it's a cheap to own and nice to have 3rd car.
6. 2001 Dodge Grand Caravan - We had to get one when Kendall was born. With 5 in the family and trips to take, the space is really needed and used.
7. 2000 GMC Yukon XL - Nice truck, never drove it beyond a few minor errand trips or some road trips. Tia liked it, the kids loved it with screens in back. It was an indulgance and we sold it fairly quickly.
8. 1993 Isuzu Trooper LS - This was my second Trooper and I really enjoyed it. I had it for 4 years and it served me well, though in early 2002, it required quite a bit of work.
9. 1970s Pontiac station wagon of some sort. Cheapest car, like $450, and it ran well for six months.
10. 1990 GMC Surburban - I loved this. Totaled by an Expedition.
11. 1987 Dodge Caravan - My beater, old, ran well, and pulled our 19' boat.
12. Acura Integra, 1992 I think.
13. 1992 Mercedes 240D
14. 1975 Pontiac Station Wagon - Not sure what year, but this was a huge v-8 beast, torn up interior, etc. But it cruised down the road, had space, and was a good fit for me for about 5-6 months.
15. 1990 Isuzu Trooper LS - This was my frist Trooper, actually my first new car as well.
16. 1980ish Saab 900 - A sweet car out of college. Engine troubles doomed this car.
17. 1982 Pontiac Bonneville - Tore up my shoulder and my parents gave me this when I couldn't shift anymore.
18. 1977 Volkswagen Scirocco - The first car I bought. I loved this one, put in a sunroof, cruised the beach.
19. 1980 Pontiac Bonneville - My Mom's old car and she gave it to me at 16.
20. 2004 Dodge Ram 2500 Diesel - Tia's workhorse.
21. 1988 Porsche 911 - My Dream Car.
22. 2007 Toyota Prius - The family car that replaces the Caravan and our first hybrid. Got the last bit of the federal tax credit for this model on the last day it was available.
23. 1974 Porsche 914 2.0 - First porsche and very cool. Fun to drive and soon to go to the oldest as his first car.
24. 2010 Ford F250 King Ranch - We owned it only a few months and got rid of it. Far too many issues. Fix or Repair Daily might apply here.
25. 2011 Dodge 3500 - The diesel my wife wanted, bought new, and put on about 40,000 miles in 10 years.
26. 2001 Chevy Suburban - We bought this with 101k miles for $6500 and at last check we'd owned it for 15 years, driven it all over the West, and it has 230k miles. The White Whale might be the best car I've owned.
27. 1988 Porsche 911 Targa - dream car that I owned for about 8 or 9 years. At some point it didn't fit the lifestyle and my messed up knee had me sell this to a friend. Should have kept it :(
28. 2012 BMW X5 35i (E70) - I wanted a luxury SUV after the Suburban. I spent 3-4 months looking and got this. The most expensive car I bought, and I slightly regret it, but it's fun to drive.
29. 2020 Subaru Crosstrek - Tia wanted something to get her through the snow, and I got this for her. It's a near little car.
30. 2010 Toyota Prius - When she needed a new car, my wife wanted another Prius. Got a good deal and drove over 100k before a kid wrecked it.
31. 2021 Tesla Model Y - The fastest and best car I've owned.



## Other Vehicles

I have owned a motorcycle, though I somewhat used to consider that a "car" as I commuted on it. However, since we live on the ranch, I added a few others:

- 1990 Suzuki 500 Street motorcycle - My mom hated it, but I commuted in San Diego for almost a year on this bike. Over 1000 miles a month.
- 1997 Bayliner 24' - Our first (and only to date) boat. Small cabin and lots of fun.
- 2015 Lakota LQ Horse Trailer - 4 horse, 13' shortwall, a fun vehicles for us.
- 2006 Kawasaki 650 Brute Force - Our first ATV, twin cylinder and lots of power. Lots of repair stuff after 5-6 years, but we used it a ton. I'd get another one.
- 2015 Polaris Ranger 500 EPS - First UTV, and a handy vehicle
- 2008 Branson 4200 tractor - used daily to move hay around.
- 2018 Arctic Cat Alterra 700 EPS - single cylinder, a lot less power than the same cc Kawasaki.
- 2021 Polaris Ranger 570 - 2nd UTV, mostly to allow us to do maintenance on the other one.
