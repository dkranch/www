## <a name="retired">The Retired ToDo List</a>

Items that I no longer am interested in.

- Own a bookstore. I think the days of this as a viable business are dwindling, but more I don't know this is the type of thing that interests me as I've almost exclusively been a digital reader for over a decade (in 2021)
- Retire at 40 or 41 for six months with my wife. - I'm over this age, and we talked about it at this time. We could have, as I'd sold my business, but decided I didn't want to do this. Instead, I wanted to enjoy life and keep working. Plus, my company has given me 6 week sabbaticals, which have been a great recharge for me.
- Earn an MBA - I still might pursue an advanced degree, but really I'm a lifelong learner. I also think that MBAs and that philosophy of business first in most schools has ruined American business. This has no value in my career (as of 2001) and would be an expensive endeavor that I don't believe in anymore.
- Skydive - not sure about this one. I used to think about my kids, but they're all adults now. At this point, not sure I want to prove I can do this to myself or risk my health.
- Compete in an Ironman triathlon - When I thought of this, I was a few years removed from a couple sprint tris. However, at this point in my life, I'm too old. My joints hurt, and the physical toll would likely be greater than the mental one.
