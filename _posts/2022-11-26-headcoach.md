I completed my [Head Coach Level 1 certification](https://store.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com/shop/head-coach-certification-level-1/) from [The Art of Coaching Volleyball](https://www.theartofcoachingvolleyball.com/). This is the first step to becoming a better coach and showing some effort in improving my skills in this career.

This isn't much more than going through a number of videos and taking quizzes, and it's certainly taught from one perspective. However, it did force me to go through a number of topics that I hadn't spent a lot of time on, and it did get me to think about how to approach this next season differently.

My [certificate](/assets/pdf/heda_coach_certification_level_1.pdf) is available for download as well. 

Now to update my resume.
