subtitle: The things I want to do
---

This is a list of things that I'd accomplish before I die. I have an [active list](#active) below and also a [retired list](#retired) for those items I used to think about but on which I've changed my mind.

## <a name="active">The Active ToDo List</a>

Things I'd like to do, but in no particular order.

- Get a doctorate degree
- See the Serengeti
- See Egypt
- Jump from a plane (the hair on my arms stands on end just from my typing that)
- Save someone's marriage
- Make a drastic difference in a child's life (not my own, of course)
- Teach some kids for a while
- See Alaska
- See Hawaii
- Sing in a nightclub on a regular basis
- Learn to play piano well
- Bike through some wine countries
- Hike the Appalachian Trail (or at least part of it)
- Write a book about my life
- Write a book about race relations and some solutions that I've thought of
- Learn more about influential people in the history of race relations in America

## The Completed List

- Climbed Gray's Peak - August 15, 2002. Climbed the SouthEast Class 2 trail with Steve and Boo.
