Cutting boards are fairly simple projects, and they can be fun. I've done a few, and I've made notes here of a few that I've built.

## <a name="woodcraft">Woodcraft Supplies Board

I wanted to tackle a board with a little free time, and since I wandered into Woodcraft one day, I decided to get some supplies from them and see how it went.

I didn't buy a [kit](https://www.woodcraft.com/products/cutting-board-kit-no-2), but I did get a few pieces of raw wood. I snagged a couple walnut pieces and then some padauk and purpleheart from their cutting board supplies.

I ended up milling the the walnut into thick pieces, added a few maple ones I had, and then got small pieces of the more expensive woods ready.

Once I'd cut them, I realized that with the limited supplies, I had to make a thin, cheese-type cutting board. That's fine. I ended up laying them out on the clamps first.

This is the easy part, so I messed around with a few orders here first, trying to decide what to do.

Once this was done, it was time to put on glue. The easy way for me was to put a bunch of glue on the boards first. Get a bunch down.

From here, I then pick up each one and spread the glue. I bought a bunch of cheap paintbrushes that are good here. I got them from Harbor Frieght and just toss them after a project.

This then sets in the clamps overnight. It's good to wipe off clue where you can, and I used parchment paper to limit the mess on clamps.

The next day I went out and pulled off the clamps. Things looked pretty good here, and I then started standing things smooth.

After things were sanding, I wiped off the mess and started finishing. I had a salad bowl oil finish, and I wiped it on. Once I had this done, I set the board on a few nails that lifted it up. I covered it with a box to reduce dust and let us sit for a few hours. I repeated this a few times.

The board came out well.
