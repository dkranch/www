 With the decision on 2004 to build a barn, we also needed to build a fence to hold the horses. We decided that we'd fence most or all of the west side of our property. The type of fence isn't really a decision, it has to be a split rail, 3 rail according to the HOA, so we're stuck with that.

Our decisions are basically where to fence. Our initial submission to the HOA was 15 ft off the road for the easment and 10ft off each property line, using the existing HOA fence structures as a guide and down to the house and up along the existing rear fence.

We got approved, somewhat. The horse area close to the barn needs another 10 feet of inset from the road and some shrubs or bushes planted. I guess they are concerned about the dirt areas from some other horse pastures and it doesn't look good. No big deal.

So now the work begins. Building the fence. Our neighbor built his and said that it was hard to drill down with his small front loader and auger. He had to get some weights to make it work. I checked on a gas powered auger at Home Depot, running around $400, but it could be worth it if we're going to dig a few at a time. I bought stakes and paint and we need to lay it out.

**February 18. 2003**

We're talking with the barn guys and ask them for an estimate on the fencing. Tia and I walk around with a 200' tape measure and toughly get an 800ft measurement for the fence. We should get an estimate soon.

I'd rather do some ourselves, partially to save money and partly just to do it. However the hoel drilling has me concerned. That could eat up tons of time. We need to give one a try and see. The barn guys said that part of the trench was easy to dig and part hard. 

## Repairing the Old Fence

 So a few of the posts on the old fence around the backyard are loose. Like almost ready to fall down. So I decided to tackle the corner post by the playset first.

**March 14, 2004**

I went out Sunday morning with a shovel to get started. I pulled the rails loose and let them hit the ground. Something that I'm not sure I could do if the post wasn't loose, so that's a learning experience for the larger fence building project.

The next step was to move some rocks away and pull back the landscaping fabric. I made a mistake here in that I pulled back about a foot around the post and I really needed to pull back about 2-3 feet to dig out the concrete. Lesson learned for post 2. From here I started digging around and hit concrete pretty quick, about a foot down. I worked my way around it, trying to expose the sides and slowly dig deeper. Not the easiest thing to do with a normal shovel and here's where I had to widen my hole.

As I expose it, I got the idea that the sledge hammer may help, so I got it and whacked the concrete a few times. One large collar is hard to get out since:

- it's heavy
- you have to expose basically the whole thing
- and you may have post below the collar (I did) that won't come out

Well I didn't have the last problem because the post basically split in this collar. A couple sledge hammer whacks, however, were good because they break the concrete into a few pieces which are easier to pull out. As I got about half of them out, the post had splintered here and it came out. After about 30 minutes of working with it, I had the collar out, and could start digging down to the post base.

As I got down there, another collar appeared, this one more of a complete circle and tight around the post. Since the hole was shrinking, it was hard to hit the post, but I did work the dirt loose around it, wiggle it, careful not to break the shovel handle, and did get a couple hits and got the collar to break in two pieces. I got them out and quit for the day.

Total removal time: ~90minutes.

**March 19, 2004**

I left work early since it was nearly 80F and I wanted to get some cement. I ran by the local hardware store and they had what I needed. I knew that there were actually 4, maybe 5 posts that were bad, plus I was thinking of a gate, so I bought 5 posts, 5 bags of cement and went home. I set the first corner post, nailed a board to hold it and realigned the rails in there. I'm not sure how you repair a split rail fence, since without the post moving as much as it did, I wouldn't have gotten the rails in. Still I got them in, dumped in some cement and water and mixed it with a hand shovel in the hole.

I know that you are supposed to mix first, but that's a pain and I was trying to hurry. So I just mixed it in there.

Now the hole was big, mainly because I'd dug it with a shovel, so I got a piece of cardboard and shaped it around the post, leaving about 4" or so on each side and then backfilling with dirt. I poured the concrete inside this and mixed it. The whole bag ended about 3-4" below the surface, which makes sense given this was like 32" down. I did let it dry a little and then slope the concrete away from the post.

While I was waiting, I dug out two more posts, again thinking I only got the rails loose because the posts were so wiggly. As I dug them down, they were definitely broken and I had them break pretty quickly, leaving me to dig out the concrete collars by hand (2 again each post). I worked them out, tried to round out the hole around each post and fill with concrete mixing in the hole. I did one completely this night and dug out the second. The second hole was on a slope and was a real pain with lots of clay that I had to work loose. The collar on the third post also hadn't cracked, so I helped it along with the sledgehammer to get it in pieces that I could more easily remove.

Total time: about 90 minutes

**March 21, 2004**
Backfilled the third hole with dirt, cleaned up the rocks around all the holes over the landscaping fabric, which was very torn, but I didn't care.

Total time: about 20 minutes


## Project Totals

I still have 2 bags of concrete and two posts to do, so I'm not completely done, but here is the rough cost:

|Item |	Cost |	Qty |	Total|
|-----|-----|-----|-----|
|Concrete (Quickcrete, 5000lb, yellow bag) |	$3.69 |	5 |	$18.45|
|Split Rail, 65" corner post (2 rail) |	$8.95 |	1 |	$8.95|
|Split Rail, 65" line post (2 rail) |	$7.95 |	4 |	$31.80|

Time: 3h 20min
Total: 	$59.20

## New Fence

The west side has 2 existing sections of split rail that define the bridal trail. The plan at first is to connect these two sections (160' apart) with fencing and then work from there. The house is on the left side, the driveway below it. A street borders the north side (bottom) and the existing yard is marked as a large rectangle behind the house. The two curves show the existing driveway and the barn will sit just off that.

Here are some project phases as I work on this. They are mostly split by the length of the entries for each page rather than any specific part of the job.

**<A name="a">March 21, 2004</a>**

The first day of really working on the new fence. I decided to start laying it out and seeing how hard it is to dig in this soil. Given my experience with the old fence, I didn't think it would be that bad. So I got up and went to the hardware store to get a few things. Tia was encouraging me to get a section of two and let's get going.

I got to Lowes and they had split rail fencing, but only 2 rails. So I went to Home Depot and they didn't even carry split rail.

Hmmm...

Well, I wanted something, so I got a post hole digger and a few misc things and headed home. I've been using the kids' plastic wagon to tote stuff around, so I put the shovel, post hole digger, and most of the rest of the tools and headed for the north west corner of the yard.

When I got there, I decided to string off the fence. I tied to the top of the existing section of split tail, getting the string in the center of the top hole and walked it south to the other end of the property and got ready to tie it off on that section. Then I thought about it.

My plan was to use a piece of string and the screwdriver as a plumb bob and find the exact part. I realized that having the string closer to the ground would be better, so I tied off at the lowest rail, having the string be on the outside (west) of the posts. I then went back and retied the other side at the same height (about knee height).

Tia then came out and we measure each 10', placing a piece of tape at this point. I kept the north side of the tape at the 10' mark at each point to be consistent. From here, we put stakes in the ground at this point, the string just brushing the top of each stake.

Now the digging. First with the shovel to loosen the dirt and go down about 5-6". From here I started with the post hole digger. Oh boy was that fun.

If you've never done it, I got to about 12" and we realized this was a large project. I mean a long, all summer long project. Slow going, probably 15 minutes to get down 12". A friend had called and offered to help auger, so I called him back and knocked off.

Another trip to home depot, renting an auger (2 man gas) for 4 hours. My plan was to hopefully get 8-10 holes dug.

One word of advice when transporting these, take a box or something to brace it and prevent a tip. Also put a tarp down, which I did, because some gas leaked on the tarp when it tilted. Fortuneately I did that or Tia would have killed me for getting has in the car.

I got back and Tia and I tried to get started. We cranked it up and it barely ran. There were no instructions, just a throttle like a motorcycle, a pull cord and a little metal thing with a diagram that was supposedly the choke, but was confusing. We pulled it out at first and started and the thing barely turned. After a few minutes, we were thinking we might only get 2 holes dug.

Fortunately Tia experiments and I'd forgotten the choke, thinking it was an on/off has lever. She pushed it in and the auger cranked up. We pushed down and got down to about 18", though we didn't realize it. Kyle and I walked to the second hole while Tia cleaned the first one out and measured.

It wasn't looking good, though Tia and I got a couple holes down to 20" before Brian showed up.

Tia went to entertain kids and Brian and I got started. We sat on the handles, pushed down, everything we could and with both of us, got the first few holes down to 22-24".

We got better and kept at it and had gotten 5 holes done at the 1 hour mark. Continuing on, we got 10 holes done at around the 2 hours mark and then things got tough. The soil toughened and we could feel the bit grinding on the clay down there. The last five holes took about another hour and a few we only got to 20-21". The bit was smoking hot and we couldn't see dirt or clay coming up the bit. We knocked off and called it a day, the entire west side, 15 holes, basically done.

A few things about the auger. When we started, the topsoil is heavy, so I kicked it loose as the bit dug down to keep the weight down. If I didn't the bit would hang and we'd lift the thing and spray the dirt off. Also, sometimes as it got lower it would hang and we'd do the same thing. Not sure the weight matters, but clearing it off periodically seems to help. We also sat on opposite handles to get more weight. More weight helps, but it can bind the bit, so keep watch and lift if it binds. Also wiggle the entire auger sometimes to make the hole slightly wider and give some room.

Tools:
- Shovel (pointed end)
- Post Hole Digger
- Tape Measure
- Gloves
- Stakes
- String (1000' ft)
- Hammer
