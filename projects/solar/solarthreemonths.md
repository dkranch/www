We've had the solar system running for a few months and I've been tracking the usage. The monitoring company tracks the data, but I want a backup, so I've been working on a process to upload things.

Here are the stats of where we stand currently (skipping Feb):

| Month | Estimate | Production | Surplus/Deficit | Running Total |
|:--------|------------:|------------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| March | 1362.76kW | 1331.8490kW |  (30.91)kW |  |
| April | 1268.10kW | 1943.85800kW | 675.76kW  | 644.85kW |
| May | 1556.82kW | 1830.28kW | 273.46kW  | 918.31kW |

Three months in, we're almost a MW up on power. If this continues, I think this will be a net zero for the year, or even a surplus. Even with the Tesla.

The one thing I don't like is that we haven't enough moisture, so
