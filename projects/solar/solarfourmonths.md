I completed the updates for June and found these results:
- Estimate: 1779.60 kWh
- Actual: 1807.7500

That's really close, especially as the weather wasn't what we were expecting. It was very different than our recollection of the past. This production resulted in just a 28kW surplus (we like surpluses), or just about a 1/2 day extra.

Amazing. I got this estimate for the year last fall.

Here are the stats of where we stand currently (skipping Feb):

| Month | Estimate | Production | Surplus/Deficit | Running Total |
|:--------|------------:|------------------:|-----------------:|-----------------:|
| March | 1362.76kW | 1331.8490kW |  (30.91)kW |  |
| April | 1268.10kW | 1943.85800kW | 675.76kW  | 644.85kW |
| May | 1556.82kW | 1830.28kW | 273.46kW  | 918.31kW |
| June | 1779.60kW | 1807.75kW | 28.15kW  | 946.46kW |

Three months in, we're almost a MW up on power. If this continues, I think this will be a net zero for the year, or even a surplus. Even with the Tesla.

The one thing I don't like is that we haven't enough moisture, so
