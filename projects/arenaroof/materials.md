# Getting Replacement Materials

Once we had the insurance claim approved, we needed to get the materials for the roof replacement. We ordered them and sent over $20k to the vendor and then eventually shipped us materials.

Things came on a wet day, late in the day, and the knucklehead driving the truck got himself stuck in the mud. We couldn't pull him out and he had to call a tow truck.
