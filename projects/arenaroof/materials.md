# Getting Replacement Materials

Once we had the insurance claim approved, we needed to get the materials for the roof replacement. We ordered them and sent over $20k to the vendor and then eventually shipped us materials.

Things came on a wet day, late in the day, and the knucklehead driving the truck got himself stuck in the mud. We couldn't pull him out and he had to call a tow truck.

Eventually he unloaded 4 pallets of white wrapped materials. They were in the front for a few weeks until I could get them moved behind the arena. I didn't unwrap or open them and was a little worried about what was inside. I figured we'd get help scheduled and then look at them.

I can't find pictures of them, but it wasn't much to see. Mishapen blobs of white wrapped in plastic. They were heavy, each had to be hundreds of pounds.

We had these behind the area for months. We finally organized a consultant from the company (for $1600/day) to come out for a week in July during my sabbatical.
