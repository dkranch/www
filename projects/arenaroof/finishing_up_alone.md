Day five was Saturday. With the roof done, I wanted to return the lift. However, we had a few things to do and I was up early to get going. First, I needed to tighten a few bolts we noticed were loose or missing, so I moved the lift around, taking up wrenches and sockets to get the job done. 

My wife also wanted a couple holes patched, so that was my job. My hands were beat up and tired, but I couldn't stop. I did grab a picture for some sympathy.

One hole was lower on the back, but still high enough to use the lift. Another one got covered by the end piece, so I didn't bother. I got a low one as well.

The main one was on the West side, near the peak. This side gets beat up by the wind, so I took the lift outside and went up. You can see this hole in the picture below.

We had some spare material and glue from the vendor, so I applied it and managed to get it patched pretty well, in my opinion.

I also took a shot from the lift of the West view, looking at the big sky.

And one down at the truck. I'm way up there.

There was also one in the first section. Must have been a manufacturing defect, but it was a small hole. I patched it up with some glue and a piece of material. Here's the before:

After, trust me I got it patched.

That was it. The sixth day was Sunday when my kids and I picked up trash, got stuff out of the arena, used the tractor to try and re-grade sand, and get things ready for use. We spent most of the day here, as Monday I had this view:

That's Cancun in the distance.
