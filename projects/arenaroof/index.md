# The Arena Roof Project
After a major hailstorm a few years ago, the roof of the Arena was damaged and needed to be replaced. We submitted an insurance claim and received funding for the project.

This projects was us, with some friends, replacing the roof. What we thought was a 2-3 day project turned into a 6 day one and was more work than we expected.

Here's the roof in Oct 2024.
