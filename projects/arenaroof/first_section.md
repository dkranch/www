The second day we were eager to get going. We started by moving over one of the pallets and unrolling the second.

From here, we had to slip the metal poles into the fabric pocket at the bottom. You can see our consultant and my son working on this.

Once that was done, we had to take a second pole and tie it to the first one. It seems crazy, but we used webbing to do this and then added 4 reels of webbing to the structure.

Finally, we had to feed the 4 reels over the frame. This took some doing, moving the bucket around and getting the reels over one by one. I threw 3 successfully from near the top, but the last one was a little harder. I messed it up and had to move the lift to get it back over. Here's the final view of the webbing tied to the sectio and over the frame.
