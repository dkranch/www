The second day we were eager to get going. We started by moving over one of the pallets and unrolling the second.

From here, we had to slip the metal poles into the fabric pocket at the bottom. You can see our consultant and my son working on this.

Once that was done, we had to take a second pole and tie it to the first one. It seems crazy, but we used webbing to do this and then added 4 reels of webbing to the structure.

Finally, we had to feed the 4 reels over the frame. This took some doing, moving the bucket around and getting the reels over one by one. I threw 3 successfully from near the top, but the last one was a little harder. I messed it up and had to move the lift to get it back over. Here's the final view of the webbing tied to the sectio and over the frame.

From there, we pulled the section up.

I had to get around fence, so this the second part of the video is here.

Once this was done, we had to stretch the fabric to the frame. It's not quite reaching the ends, so we tied webbing to the grommets, pulled it over, and tied it down. The repeated every 3rd or 4th grommet. This was a lot of work, but we got it done by the end of the day.

We still had to then use 1" webbing to tie the fabric to the frame. This was slow going we we had to cut a long piece, get it through the grommet and then over the frame. Pull the entire length through (about 80' of webbing) and then repeat. For the end wall, which had a semi-taught cable in it, this sucked.

My wife thought spatulas would help and brought a few out from the house, and then made everything easier.

By the end of the day we had the first section up and half tied down. We were exhausted, but it was a good day.
