The third day (Thursday) had us stressed. This was our last day with the consultant and it was lightly windy. We needed to get moving and rushed to get the second section pulled over.

We tied off the second section to a pole and then started getting the webbing over. With two lifts, this went smoother.

We got the tractor ready and we tied the webbing to it.

I got a couple videos of this being pulled over, again, dodging fence while we did this. We had horses around, so I had to chase them away as the tractor was crossing an area where they walk.

Once this was done, we quickly worked to stretcht this across the trusses and tie it off. We couldn't pull the third section until we had this done. Here's my son working on stretching his side.

We managed to get this stretched, but then it was too windy. 15-16mph, which is a lot. However, we didn't want to wait, so we kept working on the second section, getting it tied down with the weaving and hoping for less wind. We also go the third section ready and tied up, with webbing pulled over the frame.

Finally there was a lull and in the wind and we went for it. My wife was running a few errands, and came back just as we were pulling. Here's the beginning of the pull.

Here's the shot of the fabric most of the way up.

Finally, it was up and tied down on the sides, but the wind kicked up, moving the inside. You can see the distance we need to stretch and tie down the section.

We raced to get this tied down and partially stretche to the frame. We didn't finish, and I was lightly worried with our consultant leaving, but we could only do so much. I kept stretching things while he showed my son how to pull the cables tight on the first section, using winches attached to the frame.

The end of the day had the third section up, but not fully stretched. We were exhausted, but we had a lot done. The next day would be finishing up the third section and hopefully tightening everything down.
