I returned from camping, where I was mostly unwired last week. On the last day, as we were driving home, I got an update that said the car would come on Sept 7-9. A tight window, after my post last week on [the history of date slippage](dateslip.html).

That made me think that the car was being built this week, maybe even today. Then trucked and coming to Colorado early next week.

However, today I checked and the dates were wider, but closer. I saw this:

That's exciting. I'm guessing I could get an email anytime in the next day that says "schedule this", but I'm guessing it will be next week. As we may be out of town, I might have to wait two more weeks.

Exciting.
