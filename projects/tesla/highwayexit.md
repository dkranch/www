I went skiing on April 1, the day that I got the FSD trial. I tried to record some of my initial impressions, but all I got was a few pictures of the screen, because apparently I'm an idiot and didn't start the video recording. However, you can see this is enabled on a country road, a place Autopilot doesn't work.

I drove to Keystone, enjoyed a 1/2 day, and then on the way home, as I approached Idaho Springs, I started recording. I had set navigation to [Beau Jo's pizza](https://www.beaujos.com/), so the car knew where to exit the highway.

Overall, I was impressed.
