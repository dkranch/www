As I'm testing FSD, I decided to see how it handles common drives for me. In the last year, I've driven to the gym 68 times in the Tesla. This is a common trip for me 2-3 times a week. I was also gone over 100 days last year across 36 trips, so the 68 feels low, but it's probably accurate.

I pulled out of the garage, pointed the down the driveway, mapped to the gym, and started FSD. I made <a href="https://youtu.be/HdHbIpap_I8">a video</a> of the trip, stopping it at some points because they weren't interesting. However, in places were FSD needed to make a decision or do something I let it.

The car has to navigate a gravel driveway and road, a couple stop signs with right turns onto busier roads, a left turn on a busy road, and a left turn on a three-way stop.

It did pretty well. Definitely not a trip I'd want to sleep on or be completely distracted, but the car performed well. Check out the video if you're interested how it went.
