I leave this morning for nearly two weeks. I head to Jacksonville for SQL Saturday Jacksonville 2022, then I’m off to the UK to visit Redgate’s offices for a week and then I spend part of the last week in Belgium for Technorama.

It’s not all work as my wife will join me for the part of the trip and we’ll be together in Belgium.

It’s a long trip, as I return on the 26th, so two weeks away from home. I’ll try to put up a post or two, but likely just the coping tips will continue for the next few weeks.

Now to decide if we leave the Tesla at the airport for a week.
