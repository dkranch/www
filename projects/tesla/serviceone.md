When we inspected the car, we found a problem with the coat hook on the driver's side. The sales employee helped me schedule an appointment on the mobile app, and we had picked a date/time a couple days after getting the car.

The next day, I got a call from Tesla noting that they didn't have those parts in stock and didn't want to come out without one. They weren't sure if they'd be able to fix it or just replace it.

We chatted and picked a date a couple weeks out.

There is a [video of this post]() on my channel, if you want to watch and listen to me talk about this part of the experience.
