This is a companion to a series of posts I've written on getting a Tesla. I'm documenting some at [my professional blog](https://voiceofthedba.com/tag/tesla/) and some videos at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sRpzz05MCXqxUInjwQ_ew).

I'm adding those posts, along with other thoughts, here to document the experience as it occurs. I'm putting these in chronological order, for ease of following the story.

If you are thinking of ordering one, Iâ€™ve got a referral code. You get 1,000 free Supercharger miles and so do I. Use: [http://ts.la/john92950](http://ts.la/john92950)
