This is a companion to a series of posts I've written on getting a Tesla. I'm documenting some at [my professional blog](https://voiceofthedba.com/tag/tesla/) and some videos at [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC4sRpzz05MCXqxUInjwQ_ew).

I'm adding those posts, along with other thoughts, here to document the experience as it occurs. I'm putting these in chronological order, for ease of following the story.
