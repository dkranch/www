After our [first drive](firstride.md), we got home with the app showing 172mi in estimated range. My son had set this to miles, so I wasn't sure of the battery percentage. After parking, I unpacked the included mobile charger from the car, plugged the 110 adapter into it, and plugged into my wall.

The app and screen in the car both showing the charging state. In this case, they said it would be over 24 hours for a full charge to 90%. I was getting about 5mi/hr on this outlet, which I think is a little higher than the Tesla docs as it's a 20A circuit, not a 15A one. Most houses have 15A circuits in their 110 for general use.

When I woke up, the range was 239. About 65mi overnight, which wasn't bad, but certainly didn't recover from our adventure.

The next few days, I drove the car to town once or twice each day. A trip to town for me is 25mi minimum. In between each trip, I wasn't recovering the power used in charging before the next trip. That's what [my tracking](/projects/tesla/trackrange/) showed would happen with 110V charging.

Across the next few days, we used the for 1-2 trips a day to town. Each time we returned, we plugged it in, and it seemed we were slowly gaining some charge back. I switched to percentage, and we'd get from the 60s into the 70s from the end of one trip to the next.

I actually changed the max charging from 90% to 80%, mostly to ease my anxiety about not recovering completely from day to day. That helped me, as I'd see the car get closer to the max the next couple days.

Finally, on Friday, the car had an extended period, about 16 hours, and recovered to about 78% by early morning, so I extended the max charge to 90%. Why? I'm not sure. Mostly I think to see if I could get to 90% before the next trip.

Actually, I used the slider in the app, which doesn't have great granularity for me. I did see that the car was fully charged around lunch time, which was nice to see.

There is a [video of this post]() on my channel, if you want to watch and listen to me talk about this part of the experience.
