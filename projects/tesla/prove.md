title: "Proving Minimal Charge Loss for the Tesla"
subtitle: How much did we lose?

One of the reasons I have some data capture taking place on my own systems is in case some vendor I use has a DR event. That might cause me to lose some data, since I’d be depending on them to keep the data around. If I lose my system, I can always (hopefully) go get their copy again.

Maybe.

Who knows.

In any case, my wife and I spent the weekend in LA, coming back Monday. We got home from the airport and my wife said the Tesla was really low. The charge level was at 22%. She thought sitting parked at the airport from Fri-Mon drained a lot of charge. I countered that it hadn’t lost much of anything.

I had actually left home Tues morning and returned late Thur, so I hadn’t driven the car (or plugged it in) since Monday. My wife said she hadn’t driven much, so there should be more charge.

To settle the situation and understand, I turned to my Teslamate data logger. It’s been running in a container on my machine (Actually a few) and keeps the data backed up.

If you look at the charge level, you’ll see that I got up to the 76% level (the max setting for us) on Monday.

I was in Seattle at 12:50p Tuesday when someone started driving it around. The normal driving that day took the charge down to 59%. I’m guessing a few errands throughout the day.

Then this remained the state until Friday morning just before 9a. That’s when I left for yoga, and you can see I drained down some charge.

I got home and plugged it in, but because I have this set for overnight charging, nothing happened at first. I finally remembered to click “start charge”, but only added 2"%.

That’s what we took to the airport. The drive up drained the batter down to 41%, and I’m guessing another % went down with cabin overheat running. This runs for a bit of time after the car is locked (it was hot in DEN). The charge remained at 40 through the weekend until Monday morning.

Driving home was the dip down to the 22% where we ended up in the right side of the graph above.

Not that I wanted to win an argument, but more verify that what I told my wife was correct. We have sentry off and we should lose minimal charge from the car being parked.
