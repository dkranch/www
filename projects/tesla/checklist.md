title: "Finding a Checklist"

Every car I've purchased in the past was something I could look at before making a decision. Often this was from private parties, but in any case, I could walk around, look at the car, and try to decide what to check. For a couple of the ranch vehicles, this wasn't the case, but that's a different process altogether. Those were new and really they are commodities.

For the most part, I usually looked up recall notices, common issues, and then walked around. For my Porches, I actually found checklists ([914](https://www.pelicanparts.com/914/How_to_buy_a_914.htm), [911](https://www.pistonheads.com/features/ph-buying-guides/porsche-911-964--ph-used-buying-guide/43438)) to look at since these were older cars. I went through the things to look at and then had a mechanic go behind me.

For the Tesla, I haven't seen the car. It's new, and under warranty, so I am not too worried, but there have been plenty of complaints about build quality over the last few years for Model 3/Y cars. 

I looked around and found these:
- [Tesla Model S Delivery Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nlZhDYtCinX_Wkb9OST-QBzervVp5yABMVBS266Q3W4/pub#h.xh3qkzmft74a)
- [Tesla Delivery Checklist](https://medium.com/electricworld/tesla-delivery-checklist-a142d47af80a)
- [Inspect T](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.seyoon.labs.inspecttesla) (Android app)
- [Model Y Checklist](https://github.com/mykeln/teslaprep/blob/master/model_y_checklist.md)
- [Day of delivery checklist](https://teslamotorsclub.com/tmc/threads/inspection-check-list-day-of-delivery.202541/)

Lots of choices. Ultimately, I got the app, which I'll use, and then I printed out the checklist and will let my wife or son go through that one. We might duplicate some effort, but between 2-3 of us, we should get things checked out.

There is a [video of this post](https://youtu.be/BWCL1JpDClA) on my channel, if you want to watch and listen to me talk about this part of the experience.
